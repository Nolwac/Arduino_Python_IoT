# Arduino_Python_IoT
This is a repository to demonstrate a glimpse of IoT with Arduino and Python, using Django as the webframework.
Internet of Things is a very fast growing technology and with the current technological advancement, many have the need to control their devices either localy withing their homes or even from the internet directly. This Project basically demonstrate that, using Python 2.7, Arduino and Django on the server side.
Raspberrypi is also a very strong mini computer device that works well for IoT based projects, But for the purpose of demonstration Arduino is a very good choice here since it is very much less costly and there for very affordable. Download the project and tweek it to your need.
The requirements for this project are:
Arduino(NANO, UNO, MEGA, any one),
Python 2.7,
pySerial (python module),
Django >= 2.0.
Basically The Python communicates with the arduino through the serial port of your PC using pyserial and then communicates to the website running on django for any switching by the user. This application can be customized to add user authentication and some also cool stuff, including a very nice user interface on both the web and the PC application itself
